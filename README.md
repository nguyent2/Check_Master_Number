# Master Numbers

Numerologists consider the Life Path Number to be the most important number in one's numerology chart. The Life Path Number is a number which is derived from the sum total of the digits that make up your birth date (with a couple of exceptions). 

The exceptions occur with master numbers, such as the month of November, which is the 11th month, or birthdays on the 11th or 22nd, or sum totals of 11, 22, or 33. These master numbers are not converted to single digits in the process of computing a Life Path number. Master numbers are always 11, 22, and 33 (not all numbers divisible by 11).
This program checks to see if the user's inputs (including the user's separate date of birth, month of birth, and year of birth) are master numbers of not.
If any number (any input) is a master number, print it out.
If not, print the sum of the digits of it.
